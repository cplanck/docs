## Transport-optimized crate

All SIMB3s ship in a custom crate that is within limits of standard (non-freight) shipping requirements. The box is made exclusively of plywood and heat-treated lumber to abide by shipping import regulations.

The box is a two-part design with a carry-case (lower half) that couples to a box-top. This combination gives you flexibility during transport while also ensuring the instrument remains protected at all times. 

It's common to ship the instrument with box top installed, but to then remove it when loading the buoy into a space restricted area, such as a helicopter.

## No lithium batteries

SIMB3 does not contain any lithium batteries. The internal battery is a custom alkaline battery, and is not subject to international regulations on lithium air-transport.

## Removable ballast

A standard SIMB3 ships with a 23 lb ballast. With the box top removed, the ballast can be separated to lighten the instrument during hand transport.
