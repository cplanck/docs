## Production timeline

After we receive a purchase order, it generally takes 2-6 months to produce your instrument and have it delivered. This depends on a host of factors, however, and expedited orders are possible. 



## Invoicing requirements
We typically request a 50% down payment for all orders before we start production. We understand that this is not always possible, however, and we generally can work with you to move forward regardless. 

The remaining balance is invoiced after delivery.
