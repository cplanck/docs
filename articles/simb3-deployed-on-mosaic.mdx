## About the video

The <Link href="https://mosaic-expedition.org/">Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate</Link> (MOSAiC) was a yearlong expedition into the Central Arctic that ran from September 2019 &ndash; October 2020. During this record-setting expedition, four Cryosphere Innovation <Link href="/simb3">Seasonal Ice Mass Balance buoys</Link> (SIMB3s) were deployed as part of a distributed network of instruments that surrounded German icebreaker Polarstern.

In this video, University of Utah PhD student <Link href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~rmoore/MOSAiC.html">Ryleigh Moore</Link> walks through how to deploy an SIMB3 at one of the MOSAiC distributed network sites.

### What you'll learn
- How to unbox SIMB3
- How to activate SIMB3 and confirm transmission to Iridium
- How to properly assemble SIMB3
- How to install SIMB3 into the ice hole
