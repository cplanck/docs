We offer several sensor packages that can be added upon request. These include:
- A <Link href='/docs/simb3-ctd'>micro CTD add on</Link> for moored CTD casts taken from the bottom of the buoy. 
- Apogee Pyranometers for measuring incident and reflected sunlight
- A radio-equipped datalogger for interacting with nearby remote nodes (<span class='textGradient'>Experimental</span>)

We can also work with you to create a custom solution that adds, subtracts, or modifies the existing SIMB3 sensor payload to suit your observational objectives.

## Payload Considerations

Engineered as a platform, SIMB3 has features that support the addition of an arbitrary number of additional sensors. There are, however, several considerations that must be weighed when considering modifying sensor payloads.

### Physical compatibility
Auxiliary sensors must physically fit on the buoy and should not greatly modify its weight. SIMB3 is a floating instrument, so additional weight modifies the buoyancy characteristics and flotation depth. 

### Electronic compatibility & Power Requirements

SIMB3 is equipped with a custom Arduino-based datalogger that interfaces with each sensor and transmits data via satellite. By default, additional sensor payloads are interfaced via I2C directly or via an adapter board. 

Generally speaking, auxiliary sensor payloads must have reasonable power requirements, however, what constitutes a reasonable power requirement is subjective as it depends on the desired lifespan of the instrument.


### Data payload
Satellite communication is accomplished via the Iridium Short Burst Data (SBD) messaging service for low-cost, reliable, worldwide communication. Additional data payloads must generally fit into a single SBD message, which is capped at 340 bytes. A minimally-equipped SIMB3 uses approximately 20 bytes (latitude and longitude, time stamp, battery voltage, and diagnostics).

## Custom solutions

If you're interested in using SIMB3 for your next project but need a custom sensor suite or modified hardware, <Link href='/contact'>let us know</Link> and we'll work with you to build your perfect instrument.
